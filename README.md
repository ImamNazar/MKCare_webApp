# MKCare_webApp

The MkCare is a completely responsive online application that was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for a healthcare center or hospital. The repository basically consists of three web applications: one for the patient/user, one for the physicians, and one that connects to the same database. Since each file is kept in its own folder, obtaining any file from the repository would be simple.
