# MKCare_webApp

The MkCare is an HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP-based online application that was created for a healthcare center or hospital. The repository is really made up of three web applications: one for the user/patient, one for the physician, and one that connects to the same database. Since each file is kept in its own folder, obtaining any file from the repository should be simple.
